In this version, working machinery for calculating scattering angle from Compton/Rayleigh scattering is included.

Following are the main changes made in Analyzer while debugging:
- sorting hits array in time.
- including rayl scat also for registering the hits. though it is not possible in reality.  
- will need to reject those events for polarisation study.
