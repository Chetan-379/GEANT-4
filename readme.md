In this version, I have applied QE of a SiPM at the rear surface of LYSO for the detection of scintillation photon reaching there.
-have used the built-in surface efficiency property for the purpose.

=================================
To run the simulation:

`mkdir build`

`cd build`

`cmake ..`

`make`

`./CCal_OpON`   (to run with visualization)

`./CCal_OpON run.mac <output file name>`   (to run in batch mode)
