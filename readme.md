-In this version mainly the Hit machinery is modified. Following are the changes made:
- fixed the bug of overwriting the hits in the hit collection.
- Instead of storing the hits of all SD, Hits of only relavant SD is stored. (only compton scattering need to include photo electric also)
- Merging the hits of SDs corresponding to different logical volumes in a single hit collection.
